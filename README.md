# MCHTTPRequestLogger - Output HTTP requests made with AFNetworking in the debug console.

`MCHTTPRequestLogger` is an extension to [AFNetworking](http://github.com/AFNetworking/AFNetworking/) that logs every requests and responses as they are sent and received. It is a lot more verbose than [AFHTTPRequestOperationLogger](http://github.com/AFNetworking/AFHTTPRequestOperationLogger/), by design.

## Example Usage

Just add the following code to your `UIApplicationDelegate`, in the method `-application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` and you should see extensive information for each requests/responses in your Xcode console.
```objc
[[MCHTTPRequestLogger sharedLogger] startLogging];
// Set the JSONOutputStyle property to have pretty printed JSON output
[[MCHTTPRequestLogger sharedLogger] setJSONOutputStyle:MCHTTPRequestLoggerJSONOutputStylePrettyPrinted];
```

## Important Notes

- This code has been known to work on iOS 5.x+.
- This code uses **Automatic Reference Counting**, if your project does not use ARC, you must add the `-fobjc-arc` compiler flag to each implementation files in `Target Settings > Build Phases > Compile Source`.
- This code also uses the **literals syntax**, so at least Xcode 4.5 is required.

## Adding to your project

If you're using [`CocoaPods`](http://cocoapods.org/), there's nothing simpler.
Add the following to your [`Podfile`](http://docs.cocoapods.org/podfile.html)
and run `pod install`

```
pod 'MCHTTPRequestLogger'
```

Don't forget to `#import "MCHTTPRequestLogger.h"` where it's needed.
